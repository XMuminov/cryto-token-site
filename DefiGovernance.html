                     Platforms that combine peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, algorithmic automation, and community incentive
                     systems with decentralized finance (DeFi) have seen enormous growth in 2020, bringing the industry
                     to the forefront of blockchain and financial technology (FinTech). Via the use of tokenized
                     governance systems, DeFi aims to create more fair and decentralized organizations and industries
                     than are now possible through traditional peer-to-peer trade or the blockchain nodal structure.

                     Reiterating the blockchain community's persistent commitment to decentralization by giving users
                     access to governance tokens. By using these governance tokens, the worldwide and decentralized
                     community of stakeholders who utilize the platform and participate in the broader DeFi ecosystem
                     may take over administration of the platform from the project's small group of founders, employees,
                     and insiders.

                     In order to make important choices concerning protocol updates, recruiting engineers, and even
                     altering governance frameworks for DeFi initiatives, the project relies on governance procedures.
                     For example, the governance process of a borrowing and lending platform may be used to decide the
                     amount of collateral necessary to borrow money or to alter its interest rate model. Like a central
                     exchange, a decentralized exchange (DEX) may modify the way its liquidity pools are handled by
                     using its governance system. Another option is to leverage the governance process of a yield
                     farming platform to employ a third-party code auditor.

                     Governance Models for Blockchain
                  </h5>
                  <p class="p16-text26 models-text">
                     Off-chain processes like as conferences, mailing lists, online forums, and other modes of
                     coordination and decision-making were first used to establish the foundations of blockchain
                     governance. Some stakeholders are more powerful than others in off-chain systems, though. Bitcoin
                     core developers and miners, for example, have the greatest sway in the Bitcoin ecosystem since more
                     casual users do not have the official methods of registering their participation.
                  </p>
                  <p class="p16-text26 models-text">
                     An on-chain governance system that allows stakeholders to vote directly on protocol updates was
                     created to give individual users greater power in the governance process. If a proposal receives
                     the necessary number of votes, it is implemented in a smart contract and becomes a reality. The
                     majority of DeFi solutions rely on on-chain governance. In order to cast a vote or propose a
                     proposal, you usually need to have some kind of "governance token". There is some evidence to
                     support the claim that on-chain governance is plutocratic due to the fact that the number of tokens
                     a user owns frequently affects the weight of their vote.

                     If you want to vote or propose, you'll need to stake your governance tokens, which normally use the
                     ERC-20 token standard and are commonly kept as collateral for that purpose. Initially, governance
                     tokens cannot be acquired, however they may trade on exchanges following distribution as a reward
                     for adopting the system. As a result, DeFi platform governance tokens have often been the subject
                     of conjecture and speculation. A good protocol should thus make governance tokens more valuable
                     since they provide protocol users greater influence over the allocation of resources and the
                     ability to change incentives and capital flows.

                     Processes of DeFi Governance
                  </h5>
                  <p class="p16-text26 models-text">
                     A platform's governance can only commence after tokens have been issued. DeFi governance structures
                     that are most often used all follow the same basic procedure:
                  </p>
                  <p class="p16-text26 models-text">
                     In the early stages of DeFi governance, stakeholders gather information about the community's views
                     on particular concerns and possible adjustments. A platform's official governance forum and
                     unofficial communication channels both host discussions. Ideally, discussion should focus on ideas
                     and policy, however politicking is common as individuals strive to persuade others in the community
                     to endorse their ideas or recommendations.
                  </p>
                  <p class="p16-text26 models-text">
                     In an effort to bring forth new modifications to the system in a systematic and transparent manner,
                     improvement proposals use a generic template consisting of the proposal's context and description
                     as well as the code that may be changed. For the time being, developers are the ones who are
                     submitting the bulk of the upgrade ideas. It is possible to debate and examine a suggested code
                     modification in the community, and then modify it if required.
                  </p>
                  <p class="p16-text26 models-text">
                     In order to have a valid vote, there must be a majority of those present, called a quorum. When a
                     proposal has 100% support from voters, but the number of token holders who vote does not match the
                     minimum percentage necessary, the vote is typically canceled. Low involvement in DeFi governance is
                     a major issue. As a result, they may not be interested in participating in governance since it is
                     time-consuming, less immediately rewarding, and/or they lack a strong opinion on the proposed
                     modification to the protocol. In this case, they may not be interested in participating.
                  </p>
                  <p class="p16-text26 models-text">
                     For the majority of DeFi protocols, a simple majority of more than 50% is sufficient to implement a
                     new proposal on the blockchain. When an entity has a larger number of tokens, their vote has
                     greater sway. Token holders may assign their voting authority to another address if they do not
                     want to vote themselves. Once a vote has been taken, the idea may be put into practice.
                  </p>
                  <p class="p16-text26 models-text">
                     Changing the code is the last phase in the decentralized governance process since recommendations
                     are generally software modifications.

                     What Is Yield Farming? Examples of Compounds
                  </h5>
                  <p class="p16-text26 models-text">
                     As the first DeFi system to include a governance token, Compound set the standard for others to
                     follow. A "yield farming" technique that aims to increase DeFi platform incentive structures was
                     sparked by the launching of the COMP token in June 2020. People that contribute crypto assets to
                     DeFi protocols in exchange for governance tokens are known as "yield farmers." DeFi dApps may then
                     use these governance tokens to earn interest or get access to a variety of digital assets and
                     financial instruments when they are deposited. Other DeFi systems followed Compound's example
                     because of the efficiency of yield farming in bringing in fresh money and the skyrocketing value of
                     governance tokens.
                  </p>
                  <p class="p16-text26 models-text">
                     Platforms and solutions developed by DeFi are at the forefront of blockchain governance, proving
                     that decentralization need not be sacrificed for efficiency. For now, however, DeFi governance
                     tokens and fair launches imply that its main procedures will likely have a long-term influence on
                     the blockchain industry.
